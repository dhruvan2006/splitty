# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization


Mark: Pass

Feedback: The meeting had a chair and a minute taker


#### Agenda 


Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: The agenda was not added to the repository in time. It was uploaded an hour before, try to upload it at least a day before. The individual points were not clear, giving them more description can help solve this.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker




Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The minutes were *not* merged into the agenda, please try to put them in the same document. The amount of notes is fine but is unorganised, organising some points under a common theme could be a good idea. The notes are missing action points, adding them could make the team work during the week smoother.     


#### Chair performance


Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The chair went through most of the topics. Spent way too long on some topics, the chair should move onto other topics when this happens to cover the points of the agenda.


#### Attitude & Relation



Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The team had ownership in the meeting. Not everyone was participating in the meeting. The team should pay attention when they observe that somebody is not participating in the meeting and then encourage them to give their opinion. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: The team presented their application, not a lot of progress was made and the application is not connected. The team should work on connecting the frontend and the backend soon as the progress may take a while. The team needs to start picking up the pace to finish the application in time.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team



Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: The students didn't discuss this, please make sure to reflect on your progress each week!
