# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization


Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and a minute taker


#### Agenda 


Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was uploaded on time and followed the template. The points were a bit too short, making it a bit vague. Giving more detail can make the agenda clearer.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker



Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: The meeting notes were not merged to the agenda. Moreover, the meeting notes are too short and vague. Please try to take more notes during the meeting!


#### Chair performance


Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The chair covered almost all the topics but spent too much time on a few topics. The chair should recognize this and move on to the other topics to fully cover the agenda.


#### Attitude & Relation



Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The team discussions are constructive and everyone participates in them. No one is talking over each other and everyone listens to each other. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product



Mark: Good

Feedback: The team made a lot of progress compared to last week. Still the application is not shippable but if the team keeps up this pace,  they will create a working application at project end. Keep it up :D !


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team



Mark: Good

Feedback: The team didn't reflect on the previous week but from the meeting it seemed like everyone contributed equally to the project last week. Please reflect on the previous weeks to spot potential weaknesses in your work flow.
