# Meeting



#### Meeting Organization



Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and a minute taker for the meeting



#### Agenda 



Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The agenda was added 1 hour before the meeting please try to upload it at least a day before the meeting. The agenda did not follow the template that was provided. The individual points were not fully clear. To fix this I'd recommend looking at the provided template as filling it in the same way should fix the issue of points not being fully clear.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker


Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The notes *were* added to the repository. They were made in a different file, they should be merged *into* the agenda file. The amount of notes isn't that much and not fully clear. Next time the minute taker should put extra care into writing the minutes in more detail as this will reduce any possible confusion. People are assigned to task but the assignments are not organised. Making a table of people and their assigned tasks could be a way to organise them.


#### Chair performance


Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: The chair did not fully follow the agenda. A lot of topics that were not in the agenda were discussed instead. The chair should either try to first discuss the topics in the agenda or upload the agenda in a timely manner so that the topics of the agenda are more extensive (thus reducing the possibility of off-topic discussion)

#### Attitude & Relation


Mark: *Excellent*

Feedback: The team had ownership of the meeting, everyone was talking equally. Everyone's ideas were being listened to and the overall atmosphere was constructive.




#### Potentially Shippable Product



Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: There was no product demo, remember that you should allocate some time for this each week.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team



Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: This was *very* briefly mentioned. From that brief discussion it seems that the workload was divided equally last week. However no goals from last week was mentioned, making it hard to evaluate if the work done last week was up to the team's desires. The team should allocate more time for reflecting on the last week to spot any weaknesses in the workflow of the team.
