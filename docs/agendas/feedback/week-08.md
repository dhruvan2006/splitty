# Meeting



#### Meeting Organization


Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and a minute taker


#### Agenda 


Mark: Sufficient
Feedback: The agenda was added a few hours before the meeting, the chair should upload it at least a day before so that the team can prepare. Moreover, the agenda didn't follow the format and was very brief, making it ambigious.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker



Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: The minutes were not merged to the agenda file. Moreover, the notes were too brief and hence did not cover the meeting well. The note taker should take more notes during the meeting to give the minutes more detail.


#### Chair performance



Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The chair went through some parts of the agenda, but there were a lot of off-agenda discussions. While they are fine, the chair should first prioritize the agenda points before moving on to off-agenda points.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent.

Feedback: The team atmosphere is friendly and respectful. This makes the discussions very constructive and insightful and everybody participates the same amount in the meeting. Good job!


#### Potentially Shippable Product



Mark: Good

Feedback: The team did a lot of work compared to last week. If they continue this pace, they can finish the basic requirements.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team


Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: This did not seem to be mentioned.
