# Team 78

#### Meeting Organization


Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and minute taker


#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The agenda was uploaded to gitlab on time. It did not follow the template. The discussion points could be more detailed to give the team more of an idea of what will be discussed.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker


Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: There were no previous minutes uploaded.


#### Chair performance

*TA Instructions:*

Mark: Good

Feedback: The chair went over the topics and then gave around the expected time on each topic. The time estimates on the agenda were accurate. The meeting sometimes delved into discussion of topics that were not related to the project. When this happen the chair should notice it and pull the conversation back around.


#### Attitude & Relation


Mark: Good

Feedback: The team had ownership of the meeting. However the meeting began a lot later than the initial meeting time because of some members being late. The team should determine a protocol for such cases and each team member should try to make the meeting on time. Other than that, the team atmosphere is really positive and constructive.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: There was no product demo, remember that you should allocate some time for this each week.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team



Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: This was not discussed, each team member should discuss the work they did last week in the meeting. This can help in reflecting on the productivity of last week, helping find errors/areas of improvement in the team task allocation.
