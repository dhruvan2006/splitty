#### Meeting Organization


Mark: Fail

Feedback: There was no chair and minute taker appointed before the meeting. Make sure to appoint them before the meeting begins.


#### Agenda 


Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: There was no agenda prepared by the chairman. Having an agenda will help structure the meeting, leading to a more effective discussion.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker




Mark: N/A

Feedback: N/A

Since there was no *Previous* minute taker, for this week only, there will be no feedback for it.

#### Chair performance




Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: There was no agenda prepared by the chair. So the chair couldn't structure the meeting. The chair tried their best to lead the meeting. Next time the chair should prepare an agenda which will make it easier to lead the meeting.


#### Attitude & Relation



Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The team didn't have lead in the meeting and  topics were not discussed without TA intervention. However, the team atmosphere was constructive and everybody was listened to once the discussion began. Everybody contributed to the discussion and equal amount. Next time, the team should have a goal for the meeting to have more control over it.



#### Potentially Shippable Product



Mark: N/A

Feedback: Since this was beginning of the first week of coding , no proper feedback can be given on the product this week. In the next meetings, a part of the meeting should be used to show the process made for developing the product.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team



Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: There was no mention of the action list of last week. For next meetings a reflection upon the past week (What was planned vs What was done) should be included.
