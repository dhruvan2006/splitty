# Notes from Minute Taker

### Goal
Complete every single basic requirement. 

Need to add tests that actually have purpose instead of just getters and setters. 

For testing client side. Move logical parts of client into services and test them. Use mockito for server. No need to test UI elements.


### Division of Tasks

| Person  | Task                                  |
|---------|---------------------------------------|
| Tavi    | Long polling                          |
| Eduard  | Websockets                            |
| Dhruvan | Debts + Splitty server                |
| Armand  | 2 bug fixes (figma) + import json bug |
| Efe     | Complete 'last activity' + add tests  |

Armand and Dhruvan switch to long-polling/websockets if time suffices.

### Misc
If we don't use the combo box in overview before friday next week we delete it.
