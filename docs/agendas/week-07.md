## Notes from minute taker
Goal: get basic requirements done <br>
Most important thing: Get expenses and settle debts button done functional.

#### Problems
- other structure than expected in expense mr:
  - two diff scenes for add and edit expense
  - mainCtrl functionality had been removed


#### notes:
- Dropdown for expense edit/add
- Filter expense on participant. Let the button stay and decide next week whether we make
- Visualise admin screen

#### todo more:
- When cancelling participant page with red bar, it doesn't get reset (Armand)
- Save expense as cents

#### work division
- Armand:
  - Finish language
- Tavi:
  - Settle Debts
- Eduard:
  - Finish expense
- Dhruvan, Efe
  - admin page

Armand, Tavi, Eduard are responsible for finishing the client side
Dhruvan and Efe start on the admin page and the rest joins them when the client side is done for the basic requirements.
