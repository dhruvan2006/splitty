Week 4 Notes

We initially started the meeting with the work we covered the previous week.

We then moved on to discussing the specifics of the project and how we would move on.

We spent a considerable amount of timing discussing how the events and participants work. Since we cannot have a user account system. 

We found a solution to make the email invite, and invite code system work.

Armand is creating Add/Edit Participants page.
Eduard is creating Add/Edit Expense page.
Dhruvan is expanding the Overview page.
Efe is expanding functionality for Start page and ServerUtils.

We are not going to split backend/frontend but rather work on the frontend and when we require API endpoints we would go and create that specific endpoint.

Reminder to not merge MRs to main without at least one approval unless its late on Sunday night post 23:00 and no one is up to review your work. 

The buddy check deadline is this Friday.
Check dates for Final presentation and inform TA on which days you cannot be present.
